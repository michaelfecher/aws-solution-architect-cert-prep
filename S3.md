# S3
Exam relevant.

## General
Object based storages:

- key (name of the object)
- values (data, sequence of bytes)
- version ID (important for versioning)
- metadata (data about the data)
- subresources: ACLs, torrent

Files can be from 0-5 TB size, no storage limits. 
... stored in bucket (like a folder in the cloud)
A bucket is a universal namespace, must be globally unique,
if a file is sent to s3, then a http code (200) will be sent.  
data consistency model: read after write consistency for puts for new objects.. eventual consistency for overwriting puts & deletes

## Basics
99.9% availabilty  
99. 11x9s durability  
tiered storage available  
lifecycle management, e.g. 30 days old should be moved to another storage tier  
versioning  
secure the data via ACLs (for indiviudal files) and bucket policies (on bucket level)  

## Tiers/Classes
s3 standard: durable, immediately available, frequently accessed 99.9% avail  
s3-ia (infrequently access): durable, immediately available, infrequently accessed  
s3-oneZone-ia: cheaper than ia, but only in one AZ  
glacier: cheapest storage, only for data archive only... retrieval takes 3-5 hours  

## Charges
Depending on... 
- storage
- requests
- storage management pricing
- data transfer pricing (x-region replication)
- transfer acceleration (S3 <-> Edge Location )

## Encryption
Two ways. 
client side encryption  
server side encryption (SSE):
- SSE with s3 managed keys (SSE-s3)
- SSE with KMS (SSE-KMS)
- SSE with customer provided keys (SSE-C)

control access with bucket ACLs or using bucket policies
By default buckets are private and all objects inside them as well
